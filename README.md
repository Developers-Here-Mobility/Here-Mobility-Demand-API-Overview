# HERE Mobility Platform Overview # 

HERE Mobility aims to democratize the mobility ecosystem. We are creating a competitive marketplace powered by intelligent technological solutions for all mobility service providers, businesses, and consumers.

HERE's central platform is the **HERE Mobility Marketplace**, a hub for supplying and requesting mobility services, for businesses and consumers. The Marketplace enables matching up end users with suppliers who can meet their needs for transportation and delivery.

The HERE Mobility platform offers two APIs: the **Demand API**, for use by client applications serving end users (passengers), and the **Supply API**, for use by applications representing ride suppliers such as taxi dispatching stations.

The **HERE Mobility Demand API** is a REST or GRPC API that enables the customer application to request, book and cancel mobility services. Demand API requests are sent to the HERE Mobility Marketplace, which matches up ride requests with available suppliers, and manages ride information and statuses.
